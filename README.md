# endpoints4s Todo-Backend

An implementation of the [Todo-Backend](https://todobackend.com) REST API in **Scala** with [endpoints4s](https://endpoints4s.github.io/).
It also offers a self-hosted **OpenAPI** documentation, accessible via **Swagger UI**.

This API is hosted on Heroku here: https://todobackend-endpoints4s.herokuapp.com (opens Swagger UI)

The automated test spec for Todo-Backend can be run here: https://todobackend.com/specs/index.html?https://todobackend-endpoints4s.herokuapp.com/todos

May be useful as an example setup of **endpoints4s**  with **http4s** and **doobie**.
All is held together by **Cats Effect**.

## Used Scala libraries

### endpoints4s

Describes the API in typesafe Scala code and produces the OpenAPI documentation.

### http4s

Runs the routes generated by endpoints4s, handles CORS and serves Swagger UI.

### doobie

JDBC access layer for a PostgreSQL database.

### Quill

Interestingly, Quill can be used to generate SQL statements for doobie, and I played around with that as well.
